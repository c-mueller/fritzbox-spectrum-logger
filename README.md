# Fritz!Box Spectrum Logger

Fritz!Box Spectrum Logger (short FSL) is a Utility to periodically download the DSL Spectrum of a Fritz!Box.

## Setup

### Using a Configuration File

#### Example Configuration

```yaml
credentials:
  endpoint: 192.168.178.1               # The IP Address of the Fritz!Box
  username: ""                          # The username used to login (leave this blank if you don't use a username to login)
  password: mypassw0rd                  # The password used to login (leave blank if your Fritz!Box is not protected)
database_path: spectra.db               # The path to store the BoltDB Database at (Absolute or relative)
update_interval: 60                     # Th interval in seconds at wich the spectrum should be Downloaded
autolaunch: false                       # Set to true to automatically start logging once the application starts
bind_address: :8080                     # The address at wich the application should listen on
session_refresh_interval: 3600          # The time, in seconds, between session renewals
session_refresh_attempts: 5             # The count of login attempts that can fail before stopping the logging routine 
max_download_fails: 480                 # The count of failed downloads needed to stop logging 
```

**Notes**:

- `credentials/endpoint`: DNS names might work, have not been tested though
- `credentials/username` and `credentials/password`: Leave both empty if yout FB is not protected, only enter the password if you use Password only authentication.
- `bind_address`: Golang notation for a binding address `:8080` binds to port 8080, accepting from any interface. `127.0.0.1:8080` also binds to port 8080 but only accepts from Localhost.
- `session_refresh_attempts`: The intention here is to allow a restart of the Fritz!Box, without causing the logger to stop. See Logging Routine for more info.


### Using Environment Variables

## Tested Devices

- Fritz!Box 7390 (Firmware Version 6.83)
- Fritz!Box 7590 (Firmware Version 7.01)

Other devices like the Fritz!Box 7490 should also work, but they have not been tested!
